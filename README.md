# Course Instructor  
**Keivan Navi, Ph.D., Professor**  
* [knavi@cpp.edu](knavi@cpp.edu)  

# Course Description  
Fundamentals of C programming 
and Unix environment. File management, communications and process control. Regular expressions. Unix system calls, concurrent, and socket programming. Learn how to program the Arduino for real-world usage, such as to control lights, motors and motion detection sensors. This course assumes the use of real hardware components in a live lab environment (not software-simulated hardware).

   *  A complete (400 page) online Linear Algebra textbook. Well, the actual text is only 200 pages; the other 200 pages are scripts for 79 videos that take the place of most worked exercises that are common in traditional textbooks. The text contains a few Exercises, but also makes use of online homework (and checks that students are doing the reading) via WebWork.
